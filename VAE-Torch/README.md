##Variational Auto-encoder

This code have been token from "https://github.com/y0ast/VAE-Torch", I modified it.

This is an improved implementation of the paper [Stochastic Gradient VB and the Variational Auto-Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114) by D. Kingma and Prof. Dr. M. Welling. This code uses ReLUs and the adam optimizer, instead of sigmoids and adagrad. These changes make the network converge much faster.
